      <p> One of the projects of the Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud Foundation is the Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian City 

The City is a 400-bed Rehabilitation Hospital and Medical Center which opened 30th October 2002 to provide care to both inpatients and outpatients. 

Our patients are provided with the highest quality of medical care by highly experienced physicians, therapists, nurses, and support staff. The facility covers more than 1,000,000 square meters, and is located just north of Riyadh in the Banban area. 

The City provides therapeutic, supportive, and educational services which are designed to assist in restoring health and function following acute illness, and to allow for a safe return to a home-based family.  </p>
